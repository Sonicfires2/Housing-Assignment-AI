For this milestone, all of the dummy data was generated by us based on the tables that we created. There 
are 5 corresponding csv files below which are named according to whichever table that they are populating.
For convenience sake, we also put all csv files in a subfolder called data-files that is located also in 
the taskC folder. 

We also have the create and load sql files in this directory as well. Both are based on the previous 
milestones.
