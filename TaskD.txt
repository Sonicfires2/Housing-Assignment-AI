No files to list because everything was developed on localhost.

Summary of how the interface should be used. Designed around normal student users and admin users. 
Initial loading in takes you to index.php which has a Sign In and Sign Up form. Normal students can either
create an account or just login with their existing accounts. After logging in, depending on whether or not
the user is an admin it will take them to a dashboard with a unique navbar. Normal students will only be 
able to access the create page and view their individual data while admins have access to all pages. We have
also provided a folder with picture images for proof of completion but are also happy to demonstrate it live
to a TA or Prof whenever necessary for grading.

We all worked together for the entire milestone. We all contributed a relatively equal amount of work.
For specifics, this was the breakdown of work:

Justin: Worked on the php backend logic for database connection and some of the asynchonous functions to collect data from the databases.

Jonathan: Populated the databases and created the load + create.sql forms while also helping with backend.

Minh: Contributed to the frontend (html templates and css styling along with some of the javascript)
